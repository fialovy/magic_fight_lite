ðŸ˜³ðŸª¨ Bastion is the shyest and nicest warlock you will ever meet. He really, really
doesn't want to hurt anybody, but you can absolutely make him do that in this
game. After all, he's 203 cm in height and has the earth-moving power to go with
it. (If you prefer a mean person, try his little brother, Adrian.)
