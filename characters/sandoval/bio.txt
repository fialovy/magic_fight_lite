😱❄ Sando is your man for ice, anxiety, and excellent baked goods! No, really.
No one does crazy cold magic like this Lord of Winter, though you might prefer
his twin Stella if you're into arson. Either way, Sandoval (yes, that's his
given name) is excited to work with you. Please don't make fun of his earring.
