# magic_fight_lite

This is the ✨ no dependencies ✨ version of [magic_fight](https://github.com/fialovy/magic_fight),
a ridiculous Python command line game that should keep you occupied for three to fourteen minutes
(and might be useful for interviews; I dunno...ask a candidate to implement their own 
character with a special ability? Or improve it in general. You're welcome.).
