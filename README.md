# magic_fight_lite

This is the ✨ no dependencies ✨ version of [magic_fight](https://github.com/fialovy/magic_fight),
a ridiculous Python command line game I wrote around 2020 that should keep you occupied for one to three minutes.

**Anyway, all you _should_ need to do is:**
1. Clone this.
2. `python magic_fight.py`

Let's say it needs to be Python 3+ to be safe. But, I mean, it's 2025 and you should
be using that by now anyway.
